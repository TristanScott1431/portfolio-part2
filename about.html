            <h2 class="fishing-header">Fishing</h2>
            <img class="fishing-pic" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/simpleview/image/upload/v1645984926/clients/greencountryok/Generic_Fishing_Image_a7dd0a42-0e50-48ad-95c5-da5639e0d976.jpg">
            <p class="fishing-p1">I spend alot of my free time fishing. I have a local wildlife reserve nearby with multiple ponds and a lake. I prefer pond fishing over lake fishing because it is easier to find the fish.
            </p>
            <p class="fishing-p3">I typically go for largemouth bass. They are aggressive predators and they get big. That makes them especially fun to catch vs other fish. They are also plentiful, a huge variety of fresh waters have them, from big clear lakes to small murky ponds. You can catch them in Texas all the up to Canada.</p>

        <section class="sim-racing">
            <h2 class="sim-racing-header">Sim Racing</h2>
            <img class="sim-racing-pic" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/img-8304-jpg-1600792106.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.800xh;0.0898xw,0.0991xh&resize=640:*">
            <p class="sim-racing-p1">I also spend alot of my free time sim racing. Being a pro driver is my dream. Sim racing is a cheap and safe way I can experience that dream.</p>
            <p class="sim-racing-p2">I'm normally playing F1 23, Assetto Corsa Competizione, or World Rally Championship.</p>

        <section class="basketball">
            <h2 class="basketball-header">Basketball</h2>

            <p class="basketball-p1">When I'm not fishing or sim racing you can find me in my local gym playing basketball</p>
            <p class="basketball-p2">As well as being a great way to stay fit, basketball can also help you make new friends and teach you teamwork</p>
